LTH Course Picker
=============

Project by Jens Gustafsson and Alfred Ã…kesson

About

All the course-data are parsed from http://kurser.lth.se/lot/ with help of the PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser (simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net)

The application is written in backboneJS and javascript. 

Usage
-----

To test the application, please follow any of these 2 links:

* http://lthcoursepicker-alfredakesson.rhcloud.com

Or, simply clone the repository and setup a local php server. 


Bugs and issues
---------------

* Detailview not updated when a course with no study period is added
* Courses containing same data but in different specialization should be merged.
